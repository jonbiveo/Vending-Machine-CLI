# Vending-Machine-CLI
Created a Venmo clone (Tenmo Bucks) money transfer service with server-side functionality. Updated a partially-built Spring Boot-based application with RESTful methods and client-side functionality to create a Venmo clone with the capability to send and request money from user's accounts, includes logging to a database for storage from the server.
